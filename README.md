SmartyPants converts ASCII punctuation characters into "smart" typographic punctuation HTML entities. For example:

|                  | ASCII                           | HTML                          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Single backticks | `'Isn't this fun?'`             | 'Isn't this fun?'             |
| Quotes           | `"Isn't this fun?"`             | "Isn't this fun?"             |
| Dashes           | `-- is en-dash, --- is em-dash` | -- is en-dash, --- is em-dash |
